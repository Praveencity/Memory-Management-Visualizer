# 🧠 Memory Management Visualizer  
*A clean, interactive tool to understand OS memory management.*

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://praveencity.github.io/Memory-Management/

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an interactive visual simulator that demonstrates how operating systems translate logical addresses into physical memory.  
It supports both **Paging** and **Segmentation**, making it a powerful learning tool for students studying **Operating Systems (OS)** concepts.

The entire visualizer is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with no backend required.
